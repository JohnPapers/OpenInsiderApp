# OpenInsiderApp
Idea: 
"Insider Trading" in the form of purchases of stock shares/options exchange drives the share price of a given stock up in a given short term window. 
"Insider Trading" is legal if the information that prompted the purchases is public and the trade is filed within a 2-day window of the trade.
SEC Form 4 filings are the government's way of tracking insider trading, and Open Insider is a website database that does this, pulled from the EDGAR database. Data ranges back to 2013.
This project specifically monitors purchases of 500k or more from the CEO, CFO, or Director of a given company with a share price of 5$-50$.
It aims to copy insider buys as they are filed an hold the shares/options with a take profit point of 5% with a time to maturity of 30 days.
